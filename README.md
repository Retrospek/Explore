# Explore
ML Path ===>

Hey! My name is Arjun Mahableshwarkar!

I'm gonna document my journey in ML here!

Starters:
- Feel a bit week in creating large scale ML solution, so I want to explore something related to Computer Vision, or Reinforcement Learning
- Want to learn more about finance /\ ML overlap
- The reason behind implementing these algorithms from scratch is honestly just self-fullfillment because I feel a bit like a model plugger if I just use Scikit-learns or Pytorch's model.
- This time I'm going to implement all the intracacies and test on small dataset that are well known to see the effects.
- This repository will be a place for all to maybe get inspiration to dig into ML, or maybe if you just want to "see" what I've been up to

Disclaimer: It is very possible that I discontinue this repo at any time because it's mainly driven by my own personal fullfillment, so whenever that is achieved no need for this anymore
