ML Path ===>

Hey! My name is Arjun Mahableshwarkar!

I'm gonna document my journey in ML here!

Starters:
- The reason behind implementing these algorithms from scratch is honestly just self-fullfillment
- This time I'm going to implement all the intracacies and test on small dataset that are well known to see the effects.
- This repository will be a place for all to maybe get inspiration to dig into ML, or maybe if you just want to "see" what I've been up to

I hope this repo helps someone out there!
- Arjun Mahableshwarkar
