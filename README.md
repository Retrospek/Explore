## ML Path ===>

Hey! My name is **Arjun Mahableshwarkar!**

I'm documenting my journey in Machine Learning here! 🚀

### Starters:
- The reason behind implementing these algorithms from scratch is honestly just **self-fulfillment**.
- This time, I'm going to implement all the **intricacies** and test on small, well-known datasets to observe the effects.
- This repository will serve as a resource for anyone who wants to **dig into ML** or just **see** what I've been up to.

I hope this repo helps someone out there!
