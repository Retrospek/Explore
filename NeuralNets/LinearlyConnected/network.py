# ---------- PROBLEM STATEMENT ---------- # 
"""
    Model: Create a linearly connected (with relu activation function) Neural Network
    Goal: Attempt to classify iris flowers into their separate categories
    Tools: ONLY NUMPY AND MATH

        Considerations: 
        - Because this is a classification task, softmax or sigmoid will be needed
        - However while this is a classification task, ReLU will be utilized for all preceding DNN layers
